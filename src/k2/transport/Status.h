// 1xx Informational response
// 100 Continue
// The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). Sending a large request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body. If the client receives an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) then it shouldn't send the request's body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates that the request should be repeated without the Expect header as it indicates that the server doesn't support expectations (this is the case, for example, of HTTP/1.0 servers)

// This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood and accepted.

// 200 OK
// Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.

// 3xx Redirection
// This class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in URL redirection.
// A user agent may carry out the additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent may automatically redirect a request. A user agent should detect and intervene to prevent cyclical redirects.

// 300 Multiple Choices
// Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (via agent-driven content negotiation). For example, this code could be used to present multiple video format options, to list files with different filename extensions, or to suggest word-sense disambiguation.

// 302 Found (Previously "Moved temporarily")
// Tells the client to look at (browse to) another URL. 302 has been superseded by 303 and 307. This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.
static const inline Status S302_Found{.code=302, .message=""};

// 303 See Other (since HTTP/1.1)
// The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a new GET request to the given URI.

static const inline Status S304_Not_Modified{.code=304, .message=""};

// 305 Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1)
// The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in the response. For security reasons, many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer) do not obey this status code.
static const inline Status S305_Use_Proxy{.code=305, .message=""};

// No longer used. Originally meant "Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."
static const inline Status S306_Switch_Proxy{.code=306, .message=""};

// 307 Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1)
// In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI;however, future requests should still use the original URI.In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when  reissuing the original request. For example, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request.
static const inline Status S307_Temporary_Redirect{.code=307, .message=""};

// 308 Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538)
// The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel the behaviors of 302 and 301, but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.

// 4xx Client errors
// This class of status code is intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user.

// 400 Bad Request
// The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
static const inline Status S400_Bad_Request{.code=400, .message=""};

// 401 Unauthorized (RFC 7235)
// Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication. 401 semantically means "unauthorised", the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
// Note: Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website.
static const inline Status S401_Unauthorized{.code=401, .message=""};

// 402 Payment Required
// Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed, for example, by GNU Taler, but that has not yet happened, and this code is not usually used. Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests. Sipgate uses this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call. Shopify uses this code when the store has not paid their fees and is temporarily disabled. Stripe uses this code for failed payments where parameters were correct, for example blocked fraudulent payments.
static const inline Status S402_Payment_Required{.code=402, .message=""};

// 403 Forbidden
// The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action. This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication via the WWW-Authenticate header field, but the server did not accept that authentication. The request should not be repeated.
static const inline Status S403_Forbidden{.code=403, .message=""};

// 404 Not Found
// The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

// 405 Method Not Allowed
// A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a form that requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource.
static const inline Status S405_Method_Not_Allowed{.code=405, .message=""};

// 406 Not Acceptable
// The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request. See Content negotiation.

// 408 Request Timeout

static const inline Status S408_Request_Timeout{.code=408, .message=""};

// 409 Conflict
// Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the current state of the resource, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates.
static const inline Status S409_Conflict{.code=409, .message=""};

// 410 Gone
// Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.
static const inline Status S410_Gone{.code=410, .message=""};

// 411 Length Required
// The request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested resource.

// 413 Payload Too Large (RFC 7231)
// The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. Previously called "Request Entity Too Large".
static const inline Status S413_Payload_Too_Large{.code=413, .message=""};

// 414 URI Too Long (RFC 7231)
// The URI provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request. Called "Request-URI Too Long" previously.
static const inline Status S414_URI_Too_Long{.code=414, .message=""};

// 415 Unsupported Media Type (RFC 7231)
// The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format.
static const inline Status S415_Unsupported_Media_Type{.code=415, .message=""};

// 416 Range Not Satisfiable (RFC 7233)

// 418 I'm a teapot (RFC 2324, RFC 7168)
// This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The RFC specifies this code should be returned by teapots requested to brew coffee. This HTTP status is used as an Easter egg in some websites, including Google.com.

// 419 Page Expired (Laravel Framework)
// Used by the Laravel Framework when a CSRF Token is missing or expired.

// 420 Enhance Your Calm (Twitter)
// Returned by version 1 of the Twitter Search and Trends API when the client is being rate limited; versions 1.1 and later use the 429 Too Many Requests response code instead.

// 428 Precondition Required (RFC 6585)
// The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.
